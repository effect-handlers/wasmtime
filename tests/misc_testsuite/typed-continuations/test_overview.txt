This file will eventually contain an overview of what the different tests in a newly
created test suite do.
Currently, all of this is contained within contA1.wast, but eventually each test
will live in its own file.

Draft content below.

Group A: No payloads on tags, no param or return values on handled function, either
  1: after suspend, do not invoke resumption
  2. do invoke resumption

Group B: No payloads on tags, handled function may take parameters and return values
  1. handled function takes argument, has no return value, resumption is not invoked
  2. handled function takes argument, has no return value, resumption is invoked
  3. handled function takes argument and has return value, resumption is not invoked
  4. handled function takes argument and has return value, resumption is invoked
  5. handled function never suspends

Group C: allow tags to have param values
  1. resumption not invoked
  2. resumption is invoked
  3. handled function suspends twice with same tag
  4. handled function suspends twice with different
