Tests:

1:
Simple forwarding, no payloads, no param or return values on function, immediately resumed by handler

2.
Like 1, but with param and return values on functions (but no tag payloads)

3.
Tag has payloads (param and return values)

4.
Continuation is not immediately resumed, instead we run a different continuation in the meantime.

5.
Continuation is not immediately resumed, we pass it to a different one as an argument, increasing the length of the chain by adding yet another useless handler.

6.
The resumed continuation suspends again, using the same tag. We install a new handler at the outermost level, which should be forwarded to correctly.

7.
The resumed continuation suspends again, using a different tag (the "inner" one). We install a new handler for the inner tag, which should have no effect
