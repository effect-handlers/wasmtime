Tests:

1:
Simple forwarding, no payloads, no param or return values on function, immediately resumed by handler

2.
Like 1, but with param and return values on functions (but no tag payloads)

3.
Tag has payloads (param and return values)

4.
Continuation is not immediately resumed, instead we run a different continuation in the meantime

5.
The resumed continuation suspends again, using the same tag

6.
The resumed continuation suspends again, using a different tag
